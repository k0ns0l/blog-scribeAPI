# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by registering/logging in via the auth endpoints.
